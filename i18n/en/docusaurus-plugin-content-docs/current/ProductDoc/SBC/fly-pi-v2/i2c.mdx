# I2C Usage

    * Use the I2C interface on the 40-pin header of the host computer
    * This tutorial uses the FLY-PI V2LM75 I2C sensor with I2C2 as an example!!!
    * Please note that I2C1 cannot be used if it is already occupied by other devices!!!
    * Make sure the wiring is secure and stable!!!

## Open I2C through FLY Tools

    * Find Overlays and select i2c2 and i2c0 at the back
    * Please note that I2C1 cannot be used if it is already occupied by other devices!!!
    * Save and restart

## Wiring and Scanning

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/SBC/fly-pi-v2/img/i2c2.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />

    * After connecting to the FLY host computer via SSH, enter the command below to output the following content
    * If using `I2C0`, replace the `2` in the command below with `0`

    ```cfg
    sudo i2cdetect -y -r 2
    ```

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/SBC/fly-pi-v2/img/i2c1.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />

    * Please note that if everything is normal, the content will appear immediately after pressing Enter, including an address
    * Please note that the address is random
    * Please note that if the wiring is incorrect, the wires are reversed, the configuration is not open, or the module is damaged, the output will be abnormal
    * Convert the address from hexadecimal to decimal and fill it into the `i2c_address:` field in the configuration
    * You can use an online base converter found through a browser search to convert it

## Configuration

    ```cfg
    [mcu host]
    serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu

    [temperature_sensor my_sensor]
    sensor_type: LM75
    i2c_address:72
    # #   Default is 72 (0x48). Normal range is 72-79 (0x48-0x4F) and the 3
    # #   low bits of the address are configured via pins on the chip
    # #   (usually with jumpers or hard wired).
    i2c_mcu:host
    i2c_bus:i2c.2
    # i2c_software_scl

    ```
