# Introduction

        We are excited to release the brand-new FLY-Pi V2 host board. This board has the same mounting dimensions as the Raspberry Pi and can replace the Raspberry Pi as a host board running, featuring 1GB of onboard DDR3 memory, allowing it to run a full LINUX desktop (based on Armbian customized optimization). The board can be used with Klipper and RRF firmware, and even run the Klipper screen when using the SHT tool board.
    The purpose of designing this host board is to make it easier for customers to use Klipper or RRF firmware. We have optimized the LINUX system image to be more suitable for 3D printers, making installation and operation simpler. Even beginners with a little foundation can quickly learn to use it. Compared to other host boards, it reduces learning costs, allowing you to focus more on enjoying the joy of 3D printing (purchase a package with an SD card pre-installed with Klipper firmware, plug in and play, saving time and effort).

## Features

    * Same form factor as Raspberry Pi 3B and 4B
    * CPU: High-performance Allwinner H5 chip, quad-core 64-bit Cortex-A53
    * GPU: High-performance 6-core Mali 450, pixel fill rate greater than 2.7gpixel/s
    * RAM: 1GB DDR3 (shared with GPU) (512+512)
    * ROM: Supports up to 128GB SD card
    * Peripherals: SPI x2, UART x2, USB x4 (USB 2.0 x3, OTG x1), Micro HDMI x1, Ethernet x1 (100M), CAN (onboard USB-to-CAN module, i.e., onboard UTOC)
    * Interfaces: Onboard M.2 interface, expandable WIFI, eMMC, etc. (proprietary protocol, do not connect non-FLY Pi dedicated M.2 devices)
    * 40-pin interface, compatible with Raspberry Pi
    * Supports 12-24V DC power supply, more stable power supply
    *预留了一个5V风扇ZH1.5接口
    * System pre-installed with Klipper, Moonraker, Mainsail, Fulld, Klipper-screen, Crowsmest, resonance compensation plugins numpy and FLY-Tools, no need for complex operations like changing sources, making it easier for beginners (requires purchasing TF card or M2WE)
