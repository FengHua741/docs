# Introduction

        We are delighted to release the brand new FLY-π motherboard. This board can replace the Raspberry Pi as the main controller and run a full LINUX desktop (based on Armbian custom optimization). The board can be used with Klipper and RRF firmware, and even run the Klipper screen when using the SHT toolboard.

The purpose of designing this main controller is to make it easier for customers to use Klipper or RRF firmware. We have optimized the LINUX system image to be more suitable for 3D printers, with simpler installation and operation, allowing beginners with a little foundation to quickly learn how to use it. Compared to other main controller boards, it saves learning costs, allowing you to focus more on enjoying the joy of 3D printing (purchase packages with SD cards preloaded with Klipper firmware, plug and play to save time and effort). Installation is also simpler, allowing beginners with a little foundation to quickly learn how to use it. Compared to other main controller boards, it saves learning costs, allowing you to focus more on enjoying the joy of 3D printing (purchase packages with SD cards preloaded with Klipper firmware, plug and play to save time and effort).
