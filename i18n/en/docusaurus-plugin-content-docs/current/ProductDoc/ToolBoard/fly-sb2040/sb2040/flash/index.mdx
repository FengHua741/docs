    :::tip

    * The SB2040 comes with a pre-flashed Katapult firmware at 1M baud rate via CAN connection.
    * The SB2040 CAN connection Katapult firmware supports both 500K and 1M baud rates; you can flash the desired rate if needed.

# Firmware Burning Instructions

    * The SB2040 can be connected to the host machine via CAN connection.
    * CAN connection requires the use of `XT30(2+2)-F` cable.
    * Below is the appearance of the `XT30(2+2)-F` cable.

:::danger Notice
* To burn the mainboard firmware, you need to burn Katapult first to burn Klipper.
* If the mainboard has already been burned with Katapult, there is no need to perform the final step of burning Katapult firmware; this is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware was not successfully burned.
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to check if an LED on the mainboard is blinking; if it is, it indicates that the mainboard is in Katapult firmware mode.

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * The SB2040 can only connect to the host machine via CAN.

        * Advantage: If you flash the `Katapult` firmware, you can update the firmware without touching the mainboard, and it supports bus connections.
        * Disadvantage: It may cause timeouts or errors when used with `KlipperScreen`.
        * Tip: If you need to use CAN, ensure that your host machine supports CAN and that you have a UTOC or a mainboard flashed with bridge firmware.
