## Product Introduction

    FLY SB2040 is a tool board developed by Guangzhou Meilun Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for the VORON Stealthburber print head. Using this tool board, you can replace the complex wiring between the motherboard and the print head with four wires, optimizing the layout. The SB2040 is suitable for 36-step motors and integrates CAN transceivers, USB ports, TMC2209 drivers, ADXL345 accelerometers, two controllable fans, and other functions. This tool board is compatible with Klipper firmware.

    * Supports CAN bus connection, more stable data transmission, lower latency, and more stable connections.
    * On-board TMC2209 driver, using UART mode, can be used for extruders.
    * On-board ADXL345 accelerometer.
    * Supports BLTOUCH, PL08N, and other leveling sensors, integrated XY limit switches.
    * Supports 12-24V voltage input.
    * MCU: Raspberry Pi rp2040, Dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133MHz.
    * Adds support for 4.7K resistors (for NTC thermistors) or 1K resistors (for PT1000).
    * CAN interface uses XT30 (2+2), supporting 15A current, peak 30A.
    * Adds on-board NTC100k resistor for measuring chamber temperature.
    * Adds ADXL345's INT1 and INT2 connected to MCU, for individual users for leveling.
    * Supports high-voltage input limits.
    * Includes a 3-meter CAN connection cable to avoid signal loss due to incorrect terminal crimping.
    * Supports 2/3/4-wire fans.
    * Modular design, Stealthburner easy to disassemble.
    * Compatible with hartk's Stealthburner Toolhead Board (fan small board does not need to be replaced).
    * Interfaces: controllable fans * 3, RGB * 1, limit switches * 3, heater * 1, thermistor * 1.
