    * The SB2040 PRO V3 is shipped with a Katapult firmware pre-flashed for CAN connection at a rate of 1M.
    * The Katapult firmware connected via CAN to the SB2040 PRO V3 has rates of 500K and 1M, which can be flashed as needed.

# Firmware Burn-in Instructions

    * The SB2040 PRO V3 can connect to the host machine via two methods: RS232 or CAN.
    * Both RS232 and CAN require the use of `XT30(2+2)-F` for connection.
    * Below is the appearance of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable.

:::danger Note
* Motherboard firmware burn-in needs to be done through Katapult to flash Klipper.
* If it is confirmed that the motherboard has already been flashed with Katapult, there is no need to perform the final step of flashing the Katapult firmware; this is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware was not successfully flashed on the motherboard.
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if an LED on the motherboard blinks, indicating that the motherboard has entered the Katapult firmware.

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * The SB2040 PRO V3 can connect to the host machine using the following methods.
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware Burn-in</Button>
        * Advantage: If the `Katapult` firmware is flashed, you can update the firmware without touching the motherboard, and it supports bus connections.
        * Disadvantage: There may be errors such as homing timeouts when used with `KlipperScreen`.
        * Tip: If you need to use CAN, ensure that the host machine supports CAN and that it is paired with UTOC or a motherboard with bridge firmware flashed.
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./rs232">RS232 Firmware Burn-in</Button>
        * Advantage: No special software is required; communication is reliable and stable.
        * Disadvantage: To reflash the firmware, you need to enter manual DFU mode or double-click RST to enter `Katapult` to update the firmware.
        * Tip: It requires pairing with G2T or UTOR to be used.
