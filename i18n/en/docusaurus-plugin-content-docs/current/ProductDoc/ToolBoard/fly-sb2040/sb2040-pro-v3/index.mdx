# 1. Product Introduction

    FLY SB2040 PRO V3 is a tool board launched by Guangzhou Melun Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for the VORON Stealthburner print head. Using this tool board, four wires can replace the complex wiring between the motherboard and the print head, optimizing the layout. SB2040 is suitable for stealthburner and afterburner, integrating CAN transceiver, RS232 transceiver, USB port, TMC2240 driver, LIS2DW accelerometer, three controllable fans, and other functions. This tool board is suitable for Klipper and RRF firmware.
