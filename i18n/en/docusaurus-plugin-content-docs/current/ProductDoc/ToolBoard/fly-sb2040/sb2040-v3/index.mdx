# 1. Product Introduction

    FLY SB2040 V3 is a tool board developed by Guangzhou Mellow Electronics Technology Co., Ltd. for the VORON Stealthburner print head. This tool board can replace the complex wiring between the motherboard and the print head with just four wires, optimizing the layout. SB2040 is suitable for stealthburner and afterburner, integrating features such as a CAN transceiver, RS232 transceiver, USB port, TMC2209 driver, LIS2DW accelerometer, and three controllable fans. This tool board is compatible with Klipper and RRF firmware.
