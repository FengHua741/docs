# Firmware Burning Instructions

    * SB2040 V3 can connect to the host computer via RS232 or CAN
    * RS232 and CAN require the use of `XT30(2+2)-F` for connection
    * Below is the appearance of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable

:::danger Notice
* The mainboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult to burn Klipper
* If you are sure that the mainboard already has Katapult burned, you do not need to perform the final Katapult firmware burning, as that is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware was not successfully burned onto the mainboard
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if an LED on the mainboard blinks; if it does, it means the mainboard has entered the Katapult firmware

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * SB2040 V3 can connect to the host computer in the following ways
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware Burning</Button>
        * Advantages: If you burn the `Katapult` firmware, you can update the firmware without touching the motherboard and it supports bus connections
        * Disadvantages: May cause timeouts or other errors when used with `KlipperScreen`
        * Note: If you need to use CAN, ensure that your host computer supports CAN and that it is paired with UTOC or a motherboard with bridging firmware
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./rs232">RS232 Firmware Burning</Button>
        * Advantages: No special software required, reliable and stable communication
        * Disadvantages: To re-burn the firmware, you need to enter manual DFU mode or double-click RST to enter `Katapult` to update the firmware
        * Note: Requires pairing with G2T or UTOR
