# Firmware Burning Instructions

* The SB2040 PRO can use the CAN connection method to connect to the host machine.
* CAN needs to be connected using `XT30(2+2)-F`.
* Below is the appearance of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable.

:::danger Notice
* Motherboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult to flash Klipper.
* If you are sure that the motherboard already has Katapult flashed, there is no need to perform the final step of flashing the Katapult firmware, which is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware on the motherboard was not flashed successfully.
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if an LED on the motherboard is blinking; if it does, it indicates that the motherboard has entered the Katapult firmware.

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

* The SB2040 PRO can use the following methods to connect to the host machine.
* [CAN Firmware](./can.mdx "Click to jump")
    * Advantage: If the `Katapult` firmware is flashed, the firmware can be updated without touching the motherboard, and it supports bus connections.
    * Disadvantage: May cause timeout errors or other issues when used with `KlipperScreen`.
    * Tip: If you need to use CAN, make sure the host machine supports CAN and needs to be paired with UTOC or a motherboard with bridging firmware flashed.

## Katapult Firmware Instructions

* The SB2040 PRO comes with a default Katapult firmware for CAN connection at a rate of 1M.
