# Product Introduction

    Fly-MMU is a multifunctional tool board, a high-performance control board designed specifically for 3D printers and automation equipment. It integrates a powerful H723 microcontroller, supports up to four TMC stepper motor drivers, and features high-voltage drive capability. The board comes with 11 limit switch inputs and can expand up to 16 limit switches via FPC, as well as 4 servo control outputs. This tool board is compatible with Klipper firmware and offers CAN bus and RS232 connection options for flexible communication and control solutions.

## Product Features

    * Main controller uses a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M7 series STM32H723 main control chip running at 550MHz
    * Supports four driver expansions and high-voltage TP5160 drivers up to 48V
    * Multiple limit switch extensions, with 11 limit ports on board and the ability to expand another 16 limit ports via FPC
    * Supports Klipper firmware using USB, CAN, and RS232 connections
    *预留CAN扩展口 (Reserved CAN expansion port): When using CAN, this port can connect other devices
    * Supports CAN bus and RS232 connections, providing more stable data transmission, lower latency, and more reliable connections
    * CAN interface uses XT30 (2+2), supporting 15A current
