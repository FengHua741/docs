    :::tip

    * SHT36 V2 provides Katapult firmware with USB and CAN connections, which can be burned as needed
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./bl">Burn Katapult Firmware</Button>
    * SHT36 V2 comes with pre-burned Katapult firmware for CAN connection at a rate of 1M

    :::

    :::warning Notice

    * SHT36 V2 uses three types of main controllers, please do not burn the wrong one or it will not start
    * For APM 072 and STM 072, see [072CAN Firmware Burn-in](./can072.mdx "Click to jump")
    * For STM 103, see [103CAN Firmware Burn-in](./can103.mdx "Click to jump")

# Firmware Burn-in Instructions

    * Firmware compilation and burn-in both require an upper-level machine
    * SHT36 V2 can use CAN connection method to connect with the upper-level machine
    * CAN needs to be connected using `XT30(2+2)-F`
    * Below is the appearance of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/xt30.png').default} size="80%" align="left" />

:::danger Note
* Mainboard firmware burn-in needs to be done through Katapult to burn Klipper
* If you are sure that the mainboard has already burned Katapult, you don't need to perform the final burn-in of Katapult firmware; that is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware on the mainboard was not burned successfully
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to check if there is an LED flashing on the mainboard; if there is, it means the mainboard has entered Katapult firmware

## CAN Firmware Compilation

    * SHT36 V2 can only connect to the upper-level machine via CAN
    * For STM 103, see <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can103">103CAN Firmware Burn-in</Button>
    * For APM 072 and STM 072, see <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can072">072CAN Firmware Burn-in</Button>
