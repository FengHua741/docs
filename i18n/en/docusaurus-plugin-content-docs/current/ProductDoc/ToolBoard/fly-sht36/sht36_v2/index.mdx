# Introduction

## Product Overview

    FLY SHT36 V2 is a tool plate designed by Guangzhou Mera Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for 3D printer extruder heads, which uses this tool plate to replace the complex wiring between the mainboard and the print head with four wires, optimizing the layout. SHT36 V2 is suitable for 36 stepper motors, featuring an integrated CAN transceiver, USB port, TMC2209 driver, ADXL345 accelerometer, two controllable fans, and other functions. This tool plate is compatible with Klipper firmware.

    * Compact design, using a 6-layer board
    * Supports CAN bus connection, more stable data transmission, lower latency, and more stable connections
    * On-board TMC2209 driver, using UART mode, can be used for extruders
    * On-board ADXL345 accelerometer
    * Supports PT100 (MAX31865)
    * Replaceable fan MOS design
    * Supports BLTOUCH, PL08N, and other leveling sensors, integrated XY limit switches
    * Supports 12-24V voltage input
    * MCU: STM32F072
    * Communication: CAN
    * Supports BLTOUCH, PL08N, and other leveling sensors, integrated XY limit switches

## New Features

    * Added support for 4.7K resistors (for NTC thermistors) or 1.1K resistors (for PT1000)
    * CAN interface no longer uses MX3.0 terminals, new connectors support up to 15A current, peak 30A
    * Added selectable 5/12/24V fan voltages
    * Added on-board NTC100k resistor for chamber temperature measurement
    * Added reverse polarity protection
    * Added ADXL345 INT1 connected to MCU for some users for leveling
    * Increased heater cartridge port rated current to 10A
    * Added high-voltage input limit
    * Replaced main controller with a domestic MCU
    * Supports magnetic encoders (AS5047D) for motion analysis (currently Klipper does not support)
    * Added a 1-meter CAN connection cable to avoid signal loss due to incorrect crimping of terminals
    * Installation dimensions: hole spacing 43.84mm, M3 mounting holes
    * Processor: GD32F103 (purchased before October 28, 2022), APM32F072 (purchased after October 28, 2022)
