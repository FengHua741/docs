# Eddy Usage

    :::info

    * Please note that it is recommended to use a separate Z limit switch for bed sweeping, and not to use the sweeping mechanism as a Z limit switch.
    * When installing Eddy, ensure that the bottom of the nozzle is at least 1-2 mm above the base.
    * When calibrating the frequency of Eddy, keep the coil PCB at least 5 mm away from the heated bed.
    * Do not test the entire heated bed at room temperature, and do not turn on the heated bed during testing.

    :::

## Wiring Diagram

    * The thermistor should face downward.

## Reference Configuration and Usage Instructions

### Bed Sweeping Configuration

    ```cfg
    [probe_eddy_current fly_eddy_probe]
    sensor_type: ldc1612
    z_offset: 0.8
    i2c_address: 43
    i2c_mcu: SHT36
    i2c_bus: i2c1e
    x_offset: 0
    y_offset: 0
    speed:40
    lift_speed: 5
    ```

    * Please note that there is currently no external 1612 module available, so this configuration cannot be used.
    ```cfg
    [probe_eddy_current fly_eddy_probe]
    sensor_type: ldc1612
    z_offset: 0.8
    i2c_address: 42
    i2c_mcu: SHT36
    i2c_bus: i2c1e
    x_offset: 0
    y_offset: 0
    speed:40
    lift_speed: 5
    ```

### Temperature Compensation Configuration

    ```cfg
    [temperature_probe fly_probe]
    sensor_type:Generic 3950
    sensor_pin:SHT36:gpio28
    ```

### bed_mesh Configuration

    * In `[bed_mesh]`, the `horizontal_move_z` parameter is recommended to be set to 2, to make Eddy as close to the platform as possible during scanning.

    ```cfg
    [bed_mesh]
    horizontal_move_z: 2
    ```
