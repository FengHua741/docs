    * SHT36 V3 ships with Katapult firmware pre-flashed for CAN connection at a rate of 1M
    * The Katapult firmware for SHT36 V3 connected via CAN has rates of 500K and 1M; you can flash it yourself if needed

# Firmware Burning Instructions
    
    * Both firmware compilation and burning require the use of an upper-level machine
    * SHT36 V3 can connect to the upper-level machine via RS232 or CAN
    * RS232 and CAN connections require the use of `XT30(2+2)-F` cable
    * Below is the image of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/xt30.png').default} size="80%" align="left" />

:::danger Notice
* Mainboard firmware burning requires flashing Klipper through Katapult
* If you are sure that the mainboard already has Katapult flashed, you do not need to perform the final step of flashing Katapult firmware; this is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware on the mainboard was not flashed successfully
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if a LED on the mainboard blinks; if it does, it indicates that the mainboard has entered Katapult firmware

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * SHT36 V3 can connect to the upper-level machine using the following methods
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware</Button>
        * Advantages: If you flash the `Katapult` firmware, you can update the firmware without touching the mainboard and it supports bus connections
        * Disadvantages: Using `KlipperScreen` together might cause timeout errors during homing
        * Note: If you need to use CAN, ensure your upper-level machine supports CAN and use it with UTOC or a mainboard flashed with bridge firmware
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./rs232">RS232 Firmware</Button>
        * Advantages: No special software is required, communication is reliable and stable
        * Disadvantages: To reflash the firmware, you need to enter manual DFU mode or double-click RST to enter `Katapult` to update the firmware
        * Note: Use with G2T or UTOR
