    * Advantage: If you flash the `Katapult` firmware, you can update the firmware without touching the motherboard and it supports bus connection
    * Disadvantage: May cause errors such as homing timeout when used with `KlipperScreen`
    * Tip: If you need to use CAN, confirm whether your host computer supports CAN and ensure it is paired with UTOC or a motherboard flashed with bridge firmware
