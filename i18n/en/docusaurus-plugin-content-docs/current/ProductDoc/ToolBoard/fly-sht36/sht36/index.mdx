# Product Introduction

    FLY SHT36/42 is a print head tool plate designed by Guangzhou Mellow Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for 3D printer extruder heads. This tool plate can replace the complex wiring between the motherboard and the print head with four wires, optimizing the layout. SHT36 is suitable for 36 stepper motors, and SHT42 is suitable for 42 stepper motors. It integrates CAN transceiver, USB port, TMC2209 driver, ADXL345 accelerometer, two controllable fans, and other functions. This tool plate is compatible with Klipper firmware.

    * Compact design, using 6-layer board
    * Supports CAN bus connection, more stable data transmission, lower latency, and more stable connections
    * On-board TMC2209 driver, using UART mode, suitable for extruder
    * On-board ADXL345 accelerometer
    * Supports PT100 (MAX31865)
    * Removable fan MOS design
    * Supports BLTOUCH, PL08N, and other leveling sensors, integrated XY limit switches
    * Supports 12-24V voltage input
    * MCU: STM32F072
    * Communication: CANBUS, USB
    * Interfaces: 2 controllable fans, RGB, 3 limit switches, 1 probe, 1 servo, 1 heater, 1 thermistor, 1 PT100
