    :::tip

    * SHT36 PRO comes with a pre-flashed Katapult firmware for CAN connection at a rate of 1M
    * The Katapult firmware connected via CAN to SHT36 PRO has rates of 500K and 1M; users can flash it themselves if needed

# Firmware Burning Instructions

    * SHT36 PRO can use CAN connection method to connect with the host computer
    * CAN needs to be connected using `XT30(2+2)-F`
    * Below is the appearance of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/xt30.png').default} size="80%" align="left" />

:::danger Notice
* Mainboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult to burn Klipper
* If the mainboard has already been flashed with Katapult, there is no need to perform the final Katapult firmware burn, as that is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware on the mainboard was not successfully burned
* You can quickly press reset twice to see if an LED on the mainboard blinks, indicating that the mainboard has entered Katapult firmware
:::

## CAN Firmware Compilation

    * SHT36 PRO can only use CAN method to connect with the host computer
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware Burn</Button>
        * Advantages: If the `Katapult` firmware is installed, you can update the firmware without touching the mainboard and it supports bus connection
        * Disadvantages: May cause errors such as homing timeout when used together with `KlipperScreen`
        * Tip: If you need to use CAN, make sure the host computer supports CAN and that it needs to be paired with UTOC or a mainboard with bridging firmware installed
