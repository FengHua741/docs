# Product Introduction

    FLY-SHT36-PRO is a tool plate designed by Guangzhou Mellow Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for 3D printer extruder heads. Using this tool plate, four wires can replace the complex wiring between the mainboard and the print head, optimizing the layout. FLY-SHT36-PRO is suitable for 36 stepper motors and integrates features such as a CAN transceiver, USB port, TMC5160 driver, ADXL345 accelerometer, and two controllable fans.

    * Compact design with 6-layer PCB
    * Supports CAN bus connection for more stable data transmission, lower latency, and more stable connections
    * On-board TMC5160 can be used for extruders
    * On-board ADXL345 accelerometer
    * Supports PT100 (MAX31865)
    * Replaceable fan MOS design
    * Compatible with BLTOUCH, PL08N, and other leveling sensors, integrated XY limit switches
    * Supports 12-24V voltage input
    * MCU: STM32F072
    * Communication: CANBUS, USB
