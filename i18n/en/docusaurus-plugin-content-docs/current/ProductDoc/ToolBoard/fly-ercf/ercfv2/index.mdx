## Product Features

    * MCU: Raspberry Pi rp2040, Dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+@133MHz
    * Supports CAN mode and RS232 mode
    * Two drive positions, supporting UART and SPI drivers
    * Compatible with the original ERCF EASY Board
    * Compact design, using a 4-layer PCB
    * Replaced the 14-pin expansion port with XHD2.54, making connections more secure to prevent wire breakage
    * Supports 12-24V voltage
    * Supports CAN bus and RS232 connection, providing more stable data transmission with lower latency and more stable connections
    * CAN interface uses XT30 (2+2), supporting 15A current
