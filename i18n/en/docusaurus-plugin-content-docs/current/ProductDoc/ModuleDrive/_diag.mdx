    :::tip Infinite Position Usage Tip

    * Infinite position usage requires occupying a limit port, normally IO1 is used for the first drive position, IO2 for the second drive position, and so on.
    * When using infinite position, please make sure not to connect anything to the corresponding limit port.
    * For some FLY motherboards, the drive ports are directly connected, please pay attention to whether DIAG is directly connected to the corresponding pin.
