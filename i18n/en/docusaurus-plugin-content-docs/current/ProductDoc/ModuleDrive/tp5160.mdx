    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/img/tp5160.png').default} size="60%" align="center" />

## TMC-5160

    * Input Voltage: 12V-48V
    * Maximum Current: 4.4A
    * Applicable to: Marlin/Klipper/RRF firmware
    * Drive Mode Support: TMC: SPI
    * Stepping/direction interface with microPlyer for micro-stepping interpolation
    * Highest resolution: 256 microsteps
    * Supports stealthChop2 for quiet operation and smooth motion
    * Resonance suppression for mid-frequency resonance
    * Supports spreadCycle for high dynamic motor control chopping
    * Supports dcStep for load-dependent speed control
    * Supports stallGuard2 for high-precision sensorless motor load detection
    * Supports coolStep current control, saving up to 75%

## TP5160 Reference Configuration

    :::danger

    * The driver sampling resistor is `sense_resistor: 0.075`. Please do not set it incorrectly.
    * Only one of `spi_bus` and `spi_software` can be selected.

### SPI Mode Reference Configuration

    ```cfg
    [tmc5160 stepper_x]
    cs_pin:
    spi_bus:
    # spi_software_mosi_pin:
    # spi_software_miso_pin:
    # spi_software_sclk_pin: 
    run_current: 1.0                    # Motor running current value
    interpolate: False                  # Whether to enable 256 microstep interpolation (True for enabled, False for disabled)
    sense_resistor: 0.075
    stealthchop_threshold: 0
    driver_DISS2G: 1
    driver_DISS2VS: 1
    ```

## Infinite Limit Usage Instructions

    <DIAG />

    :::tip Infinite Limit Usage Tips
    
    * To use the infinite limit with TP5160, you need to connect the motherboard's DIAG jumper.
    * The original `endstop_pin:` needs to be masked or deleted, and add `endstop_pin: tmc5160_stepper_x:virtual_endstop`.
    * After configuring `diag1_pin:`, the limit status should be untriggered.
    * You need to test a suitable value for `driver_SGT:`.

    * Reference Configuration

    ```cfg
    [stepper_x]
    # endstop_pin:PF3
    endstop_pin: tmc5160_stepper_x:virtual_endstop
    homing_retract_dist: 0        # Retract distance should be 0 to avoid failure in homing

    [tmc5160 stepper_x]
    diag1_pin: ^!
    driver_SGT: 1

    #   Ensure that the limit status is untriggered after configuration.
    #   This pin usually uses the "^" prefix to enable internal pull-up.
    #   Sensitivity is related to belt tension and needs to be adjusted manually.
    #  (Make sure to set `driver_SGTHRS` to an appropriate sensitivity.)
