# Introduction

    * Some driver precautions


## Driver Installation

    * Please note that EN needs to be aligned with the top-left corner for installation
    * The EN pin of the FLY mainboard driver port is all on the top-left
    * DP5, PRO X10, and MMU of FLY can only use TP drivers

## Driver Configuration

    * TP drivers are just regular 2209 or 5160, and the configuration method is the same
    * FLY-2240 drivers support UART connection, but manual resistor modification is required
    * Pay attention to the driver sampling resistors, as incorrect configuration may lead to motor and driver damage
