# BDsensor

    BD sensor is a distance sensor that can be used with a 3D printer to perform real-time fast bed leveling and z-axis adjustment.

## Features

    * Replaces z-axis limit switch
    * No need to raise or lower the z-axis during scanning, improving print speed
    * XY movement scanning, enabling dense bed detection

## Connections

    * Power: 5V
    * Firmware: Klipper/Marlin
    * Connection: Tool board/main board (BDsensor will use one servo port and limit port)
    * Heated bed: Standard PEI, aluminum plate heated bed, etc., metal surface heated bed, not supporting magnetic hole heated bed and non-metallic surface heated bed

## Precautions

    * Klipper needs to download the latest BD-SENSOR patch for Klipper and reflash the main board firmware
    * During debugging, place the emergency stop where it can be triggered at any time to avoid scratching the PEI
    * Suggested scanning speed: 200 mm/s!
    * Z-axis homing speed should not exceed 5 mm/s!
