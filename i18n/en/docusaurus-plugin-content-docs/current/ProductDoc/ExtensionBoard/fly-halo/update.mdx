## Incremental Upgrade (OTA)

    * On the Halo device information page, click to check for updates at the version number location. If there is an available update, a message will pop up. At this point, click Update to start the upgrade. Do not power off during the process; wait until the progress reaches 100%, and it will automatically restart.


## Full Upgrade (USB)

    * If a full firmware upgrade is released, you need to use USB to connect the Halo to your computer for the upgrade.

    * In a full upgrade, your original settings will not be retained, and all settings will be restored to default.
