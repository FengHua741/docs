# FLY VoltUp Power

    The FLY-VoltUp Power boost module is designed for high-voltage drive applications. Users do not need to purchase an additional high-voltage power supply to achieve high-voltage drive, which helps save space when designing 3D printers.

## Product Features

    * Output power options: 48V/60V
    * Built-in fan port with a pre-installed 4010 fan, the output voltage is the same as the input voltage.
    * Dual power interface expansion: Provides one power interface, allowing users to expand two power outputs simultaneously, and each output can be individually set to 48V or 60V.
    * Easy installation: Standard size design suitable for various environments without the need for additional driver installation.
    * Compact size: The expansion board has a reasonable size, occupying minimal space, making it easy to integrate into various projects.

## Product Specifications:

    * Power input: 12V/24V
    * Output interfaces: Two selectable power outputs 48V/60V (selected via jumpers)
    * Fan interfaces: Two XH2.54 2P VCC FAN


## Precautions:

    * Disconnect power and turn off all devices before installation.
    * When using 48V output, the maximum motor current can be set to 2A; when using 60V output, the maximum motor current can be set to 1A.
    * The voltage of the two VCC FAN interfaces is the same as the input voltage, and the output voltage is the same as the input voltage.
    * The module has reserved mounting holes for a 4010 fan, and due to the large amount of heat generated by the boost module, a fan must be installed for cooling.
    * An anti-reverse and anti-short circuit chip is built-in to prevent damage to components due to customer errors.
    * Do not insert the voltage selection jumpers simultaneously to avoid component damage.
    * Correctly connect the positive and negative terminals to avoid damaging components.
