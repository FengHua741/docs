:::danger Note
Please note that the DIP switches need to be set to specific positions to connect properly to the host machine.

## Connecting to Onboard Host Machine

- Set DIP switches `1`, `2` to the right to connect the lower machine to the onboard host machine through the built-in USB.
- Set DIP switches `3`, `4` to the left, otherwise it will affect the connection between the lower and upper machines.

- After setting the DIP switches as described, the lower USB port will be occupied by the lower machine. Please do not connect any other devices.
