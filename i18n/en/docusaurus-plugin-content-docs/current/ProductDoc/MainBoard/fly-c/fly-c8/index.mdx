# FLY C8


    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c8/img/c8.png').default} size="100%" align="left" />

## Product Features

    * Uses a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+ series STM32F407VGT6 main control chip with a frequency of 168MHz
    * Equipped with TMC drivers in SPI and UART working modes
    * Equipped with DIAG function pins, allowing for easy use of unlimited homing by simply plugging or unplugging the jumper cap
    * Digital fan with selectable 24V, 12V, and 5V voltages, eliminating the need to purchase a voltage reduction module
    * New flash writing method, allowing direct firmware update of the motherboard via FLY-Tools
    * Multi-channel power management, ensuring that short circuits on ports, limit switches, or drivers will not affect the operation of the host machine
    *预留RGB接口支持（12V，5V）电压可选
    *预留SPI接口，可让客户外接加速度传感器进行加速度补偿
    * TFT screen and HDMI screen support one-wire-through
    * The system is pre-installed with klipper, moonraker, mainsail, fulidd, klipper-screen, Crowsmest, resonance compensation plugins numpy and FLY-Tools, making it easier for beginners without complex operations (requires purchasing TF card or M2WE)
