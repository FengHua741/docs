## Product Features

* The motherboard's limit switch interfaces are powered with 5V and have isolation protection; if the POWER supply is not connected, no power will be output.
* It uses a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M7 series STM32H723 main control chip with a frequency of 550 MHz.
* It supports CAN bus and RS232 connections, providing more stable data transmission with lower latency and more stable connections.
* The motherboard has BOOT and RESET buttons reserved for users to enter DFU mode via USB to update firmware.
* The power interface has reverse polarity protection to prevent damage to the board during DIY when the power lines are reversed.
* It provides two USB 2.0 ports, expanding connection possibilities; one USB port can be switched to an RS232 port using a switch to adapt to various device connection needs.
