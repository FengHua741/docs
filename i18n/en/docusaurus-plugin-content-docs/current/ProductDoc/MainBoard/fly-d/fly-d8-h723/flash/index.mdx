# Firmware Burning Instructions

:::danger Notice
* Burning the motherboard firmware requires using Katapult to flash Klipper.
* If you are sure that the motherboard has already been flashed with Katapult, there is no need to perform the final flashing of the Katapult firmware; it is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware on the motherboard was not flashed successfully.
* You can quickly press the reset button twice and see if an LED on the motherboard blinks. If it does, it indicates that the motherboard has entered the Katapult firmware.

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need
