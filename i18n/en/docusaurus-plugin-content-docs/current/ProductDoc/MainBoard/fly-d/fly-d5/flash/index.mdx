# Firmware Burning Instructions

:::danger Note
* The motherboard firmware must be burned using Katapult to flash Klipper.
* If you are certain that the motherboard has already been flashed with Katapult, you do not need to perform the final step of flashing Katapult firmware; it is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware was not successfully flashed.
* You can quickly press reset twice and check if an LED on the motherboard is blinking, indicating that the motherboard has entered Katapult firmware.

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * Please note that you only need to flash one type of firmware.
