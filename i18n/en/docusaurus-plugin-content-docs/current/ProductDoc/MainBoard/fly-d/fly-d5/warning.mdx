## Power Indicator

    * When powered only through TYPE-C without connecting to other motherboard power, at least two lights should be on: `3.3V` and `5V`.
    * After connecting to the motherboard power, the motherboard power light should be on for `3.3V`, `5V`, and `VCC`.

### Troubleshooting


    :::danger Notice

    * With no external devices connected (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
    * At least two LEDs (`3.3V` and `5V`) should remain constantly lit when powered only through TYPE-C.

    :::

    * If no lights come on, it indicates a short circuit, and you need to contact customer service.
    * If one of the `3.3V` or `5V` lights is blinking, it also indicates a short circuit, and you need to contact customer service.

## Drivers

    * The motherboard supports external drivers     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Guide</Button>

## Limit Switch Ports

    * Pay attention to the wiring sequence. For three-wire limit switches, ensure that 5V, GND, and S are correctly connected; otherwise, it may lead to motherboard damage.
    * For two-wire connections, connect S and GND directly.
    * For PL08 and other proximity switches, an external diode must be connected to the signal port to reduce the voltage to below 3.3V.

## Firmware

    * Due to button issues, the tutorial has been updated to use Katapult firmware for firmware flashing.
    * It is recommended to use a computer for flashing Katapult firmware and then using the Katapult firmware to flash Klipper.
