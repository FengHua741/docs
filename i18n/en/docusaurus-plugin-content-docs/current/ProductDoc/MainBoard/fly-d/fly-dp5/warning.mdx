# Main Board Precautions

## Power Indicator Light

    * When powered only through TYPE-C without connecting to other motherboard power sources, at least two lights should be on: `3.3V` and `5V`.
    * After connecting to the motherboard power source, the motherboard power light should illuminate `3.3V`, `5V`, and `VCC`.

### Troubleshooting

    :::danger Notice

    * In the absence of any external devices (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
    * When powered only through TYPE-C, at least two LEDs (`3.3V` and `5V`) should remain constantly lit.

    :::

    * If no lights are illuminated, it indicates a short circuit, and you need to contact customer service for after-sales support.
    * If one of the `3.3V` or `5V` lights is blinking, it also indicates a short circuit, and you need to contact customer service for after-sales support.

## Drivers

    * The motherboard supports external drivers     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Guide</Button>

## Limit Switch Ports

    * Please pay attention to the wiring sequence. For three-wire limit switches, if the connections for 5V, GND, and S are incorrect, it may lead to motherboard damage.
    * If using a two-wire connection, simply connect S and GND.
    * For PL08 and other proximity switches, an additional diode should be connected externally to reduce the voltage to below 3.3V at the signal port.

## Firmware

    * Due to button issues, the tutorial has been updated to use Katapult firmware for firmware flashing.
    * It is recommended to use a computer for flashing Katapult firmware and then use the Katapult firmware to flash Klipper.
