# CAN Bridge

CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus used for real-time applications, which can transmit signals using twisted-pair wiring and is one of the most widely used field buses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various components in a car, replacing expensive and bulky wiring harnesses. The robustness of this protocol has extended its use to other automation and industrial applications. Features of the CAN protocol include complete serial data communication, providing real-time support, transmission rates up to 1Mb/s, 11-bit addressing, and error detection capabilities.
On 3D printers, CAN bus is used to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the motherboard. Originally, it required dozens of wires, but with CAN, only four wires are needed, significantly reducing the number of wires and lowering the cabling difficulty.
This chapter briefly outlines the use of CAN bridging.

## Tool Board Using CAN to Connect to Motherboard

* Please note that the power line of the tool board is not connected to the CAN port but to the 12V-24V power line.

* Please note that the 120Î© jumper must be connected.

## Flashing the Motherboard Firmware

* Ensure that the firmware flashed onto the DP5 motherboard is the `USB bridge CAN firmware configuration`.
