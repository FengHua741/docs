## Stepper Motor Wiring

:::info
* Regardless of which manufacturer produces the two-phase stepper motor, its final appearance is four wires. No matter what color they are, black, white, green, yellow, etc., they all correspond to four wires. So we need to group the wires into two groups, A and B.
* For a two-phase four-wire stepper motor, we don't need to know which is Group A and which is Group B; we just need to determine one group. The motor direction can be configured in the settings.
:::

* In 3D printers, the most commonly used is a two-phase four-wire stepper motor, whose principle is shown in the figure below. There are two methods to identify the sequence of stepper motor wires:
    * Connect any two phase wires, turn the motor shaft by hand, if there is a significant resistance, then the two wires are a pair. Otherwise, they are not a pair, and you need to test other wires.
    * Use a multimeter set to continuity mode, test any two phase wires of the stepper motor. If they are connected, then they are a pair; otherwise, they are not a pair, and you need to test other wires.

## Bed Wiring

* **AC Bed:** When wiring the solid-state relay, please pay attention to not connecting the input and output incorrectly.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-dp5/img/wiring/bed-ac-2.png').default} size="40%" align="center" />

* **DC Bed:** When connecting a DC bed to the onboard MOSFET, please pay attention to the power usage. The maximum current for a DC bed cannot exceed 10A. If it exceeds 10A, it is recommended to use an external MOS module to connect the bed, otherwise, it may cause irreversible damage to the motherboard.

## Thermistor Wiring

### Introduction to Thermistor Types

* The wiring method for thermistors is as follows. Please consult the purchasing merchant for the type of thermistor.

* If purchased from fly (as shown in the following figure), please configure sensor_type as: **ATC Semitec 104GT-2**

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-dp5/img/wiring/ntc-1.png').default} size="30%" align="center" />

* If it is a conventional NTC 100K (as shown in the following figure), please configure sensor_type as: **Generic 3950**

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-dp5/img/wiring/ntc-2.png').default} size="40%" align="center" />

## Fan Wiring

* **Fan Wiring**

    :::tip

    The interfaces outlined in red in the following figure are controlled by the same pin for a controllable fan, i.e., one-to-two.

## Limit Switch Wiring

* Limit switches come in normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC) types. Generally, in 3D printers, it is recommended to use **normally closed (NC)**. This way, if there is an issue with the limit switch circuit, the system will promptly report an error, preventing unnecessary crashes and printer damage.

## Leveling Sensor Wiring

### Metal Proximity Switch Wiring

* VORON officially recommends using the Omron TL-Q5MC (previously recommended PL08N, both have the same principle but different detection distances) sensor for bed leveling. The wiring method is shown in the following figure.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-dp5/img/wiring/pl08.png').default} size="40%" align="center" />

----

### BL-Touch Wiring

* BL-touch has five wires, three of which form the first group responsible for powering the sensor and extending/retracting the probe. The second group consists of ground and signal lines, outputting limit signals. Please carefully check the wire sequence when wiring BL-touch. Incorrect wiring may permanently damage the sensor and motherboard!!!
  Wiring method is shown in the following figure.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-dp5/img/wiring/bltouch.png').default} size="40%" align="center" />

----

### Klicky Wiring

* Klicky is a third-party leveling sensor that can be made at home with low cost and stable performance, offering high性价比. It is recommended to use it. Wiring method is shown in the following figure.
* Project Address: [jlas1/Klicky-Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe "Project Address, click to jump")

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-dp5/img/wiring/klicky.png').default} size="40%" align="center" />

### Voron Tap Wiring

* Tap is a z-probe based on the nozzle, suitable for V2 and Trident printer designs. The entire toolhead moves to trigger the optical switch, providing better precision than conventional limit switches and can be used with almost all print platforms.

    :::warning

    Voron Tap is not recommended to connect **24V**, some versions using **24V** have a certain probability of burning out the Tap sensor. This is not a problem with the Fly product, but a design flaw of Voron Tap, please be aware!!!

    :::

    :::danger

    Note: 5V and GND cannot be reversed, otherwise, it may damage the Tap sensor or even the motherboard!!!

## FLY-Mini12864 LCD Wiring

* The following figure shows the wiring method for FLY's mini12864. Please consult the corresponding manufacturer for other screen manufacturers. Reversing or miswiring Mini12864 screens may prevent the host computer from connecting to the MCU. If you cannot connect to the MCU after using the mini12864 screen, try unplugging the mini12864 wiring!!!

## Connecting to Host Computer

* The motherboard connects to the USB port of the host computer via a Type-C interface, or it can be connected through a serial port to the host computer. Here, only the former is introduced.
