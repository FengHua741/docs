# Firmware Burn Instructions

:::danger Notice
* The motherboard firmware burn needs to be done through Katapult to burn Klipper.
* If you are sure that the motherboard has already been burned with Katapult, you do not need to perform the final burn of the Katapult firmware, as it is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware on the motherboard was not burned successfully.
* You can quickly press reset twice and see if an LED on the motherboard blinks, indicating that the motherboard has entered the Katapult firmware.

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    :::tip

    * Please note that you only need to burn one type of firmware.
