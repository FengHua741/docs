# Firmware Burning Instructions

:::danger Important Notice
* The motherboard firmware must be burned using Katapult to flash Klipper.
* If you are certain that the motherboard has already been flashed with Katapult, there is no need to perform the final step of flashing the Katapult firmware; it is only a precaution in case the Katapult firmware on the motherboard was not successfully flashed.
* You can quickly press the reset button twice and check if an LED on the motherboard blinks. If it does, it indicates that the motherboard has entered Katapult firmware.
