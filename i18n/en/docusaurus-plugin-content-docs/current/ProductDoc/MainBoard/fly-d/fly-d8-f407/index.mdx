## Product Features

* The motherboard's limit switch and other interfaces are powered by 5V with isolation protection. If the POWER supply is not connected, no power will be output.
* Uses a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 series 168 MHz STM32F407 chip.
* Supports CAN bus and RS232 connection for more stable data transmission, lower latency, and more stable connections.
* The motherboard has BOOT and RESET buttons reserved for users to update firmware via USB in DFU mode.
* The power interface has reverse polarity protection to prevent damage to the board during DIY when the power cable is connected incorrectly.
* Provides two USB 2.0 ports, expanding more connection possibilities. One USB port can be switched to an RS232 port via a switch to adapt to various device connection needs.
