# CAN Bridge

CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus designed for real-time applications, which can transmit signals using twisted-pair wires and is one of the most widely used field buses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various different components in a car, thereby replacing expensive and cumbersome wiring harnesses. The robustness of this protocol has extended its use to other automation and industrial applications. Features of the CAN protocol include complete serial data communication, real-time support, transmission rates up to 1Mb/s, 11-bit addressing, and error detection capabilities.
On 3D printers, CAN bus is used to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the motherboard. Originally, it required over ten wires; with CAN, only four wires are needed, significantly reducing the number of wires and simplifying the wiring process.
This chapter provides a brief overview of using the CAN bridge.

## Using CAN to Connect to the Motherboard

* Note that the power line of the tool board is not connected to the CAN port but to the 12V-24V power supply.

* Note that the 120Î© jumper must be connected.

## Flashing the Motherboard Firmware

* Ensure that the firmware burned onto the D5 motherboard is `USB Bridge CAN Firmware Configuration`.
