## Product Features
    * Onboard host, can replace Raspberry Pi as the host, it has 1GB of onboard DDR3 memory.
    * Enhanced 5V power protection, reducing the likelihood of chip damage.
    * Removed the SD card setting for the MCU chip, making it easier to flash firmware.
    * The system comes pre-installed with Klipper, Moonraker, Mainsail, Fulidd, Klipper-Screen, Crowsmest, numpy and FLY-Tools resonance compensation plugins, without the need for complex operations such as changing sources, making it easier for beginners (requires purchasing an TF card or M2WE)
