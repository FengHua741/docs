## Reference Configuration

    ```cfg
    [mcu host]                      # FlyOS has already generated a Linux MCU for you by default, just define it to use           
    serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu 

    [temperature_sensor FLY-Ï€]      # Host machine temperature
    sensor_type: temperature_host
