# CAN Bridging

CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus designed for real-time applications, which can transmit signals using twisted-pair wires. It is one of the most widely used field buses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various components in automobiles, replacing expensive and cumbersome wiring harnesses. Its robustness has extended its use into other automation and industrial applications. Features of the CAN protocol include complete serial data communication, real-time support, transmission rates up to 1Mb/s, 11-bit addressing, and error detection capabilities.
In 3D printers, CAN bus is used to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the motherboard. Originally, it required dozens of wires, but with CAN, only four wires are needed, significantly reducing the number of wires and simplifying the wiring process.
This chapter provides a brief overview of CAN bridging usage.

## Tool Board Connecting to Motherboard via CAN

* Please note that the power line of the tool board is not connected to the CAN port, but to the 12V-24V power supply line.

## Flashing the Motherboard Firmware

* Ensure that the firmware flashed onto the E3V2 motherboard is `USB Bridge CAN Firmware Configuration`.
