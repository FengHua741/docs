## Driver Installation

### Mainboard Driver Jumper

* **STEP/DIR Mode:** In this mode, the subdivision is set using a jumper cap by adjusting the potentiometer to adjust the current. The most common driver used is A4988. For drivers like these, you need to consult the manufacturer's subdivision configuration table and then set the subdivision using a jumper cap.
* **UART Mode:** The most common drivers using this mode are TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, etc. These driver chips can communicate asynchronously with the main controller via UART. You can set the driver's subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc., by modifying the configuration file.
* **SPI Mode:** The most common drivers using this mode are TMC5160, TMC2230, etc. These driver chips communicate synchronously with the main controller via SPI. Similarly, you can set the driver's subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc., by modifying the configuration file.

### Driver Installation

* Before installing the driver, it needs to be checked accordingly to avoid damage to the driver or motherboard.
* **FLY Driver:** If you do not use the infinite limit zeroing function, please set the DIP switch to position 1; conversely, if you want to use the infinite limit zeroing function, please set the DIP switch to ON.

    :::danger

    * **Attention!!! When installing the driver module, make sure the direction is correct, i.e., the EN pin should be at the top left corner, otherwise it will damage the driver and even the motherboard!!! Make sure to attach a heatsink to the driver!!!**

## Stepper Motor Wiring

:::info
* Regardless of which manufacturer produces the bipolar stepper motor, its final appearance corresponds to 4 wires. No matter what color they are, black, white, green, yellow, etc., they correspond to 4 wires. Therefore, we need to group the wires into two groups, A and B.
* For a bipolar four-wire stepper motor, we don't need to know which is group A and which is group B; mainly, we just need to determine one group, and in the configuration, modify the motor direction.
:::

* In a 3D printer, the most commonly used is the bipolar four-wire stepper motor, and its principle is shown in the figure below. There are two methods to identify the phase sequence of the stepper motor:
    * Connect any two phase wires, turn the motor shaft by hand, if there is a significant resistance, then the two phase wires are a pair. Conversely, they are not a pair, and you need to test other phase wires.
    * Use a multimeter set to continuity mode to test any two phase wires of the stepper motor, if they are connected, then they are a pair; conversely, they are not a pair, and you need to test other phase wires.

## Bed Wiring

* **AC Bed:** When wiring the solid-state relay, please pay attention to not reversing the input and output.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-e3/fly-e3-v2/img/wiring/bed-ac-2.png').default} size="40%" align="center" />

* **DC Bed:** When connecting the onboard MOS to the DC bed, please pay attention to the power usage. The maximum current for the DC bed cannot exceed 10A. If it exceeds 10A, it is recommended to use an external MOS module to power the bed, otherwise, it may cause irreversible damage to the motherboard.

## Thermistor Wiring

### Thermistor Type Introduction

* The wiring method for the thermistor is as follows. Please consult the purchasing merchant for the type of thermistor.

* If purchased from fly (as shown in the following figure), please configure `sensor_type` as: **ATC Semitec 104GT-2**

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8/img/wiring/ntc-1.png').default} size="30%" align="center" />

* If it is a conventional NTC 100K (as shown in the following figure), please configure `sensor_type` as: **Generic 3950**

----

## Limit Switch Wiring

* Limit switches come in normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC) types. Generally, in a 3D printer, it is recommended to use **normally closed (NC)**. This way, if there is an issue with the limit switch circuit, the system will promptly report an error, avoiding unnecessary crashes and damage to the printer.

## Leveling Sensor Wiring



### BL-Touch Wiring

* BL-touch has five wires in total. The first group consists of three wires responsible for powering the sensor and retracting the probe. The second group consists of ground and signal wires, outputting limit signals. Please carefully check the wire sequence when wiring the BL-touch, incorrect wiring may permanently damage the sensor and motherboard!!! Wiring method is shown below.

### Klicky Wiring

* Klicky is a third-party leveling sensor that can be made at home with low cost and stable performance, making it highly cost-effective and recommended. Wiring method is shown below.
* Project Address: [jlas1/Klicky-Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe "Project Address, click to jump")

### Voron Tap Wiring

* Tap is a nozzle-based z-probe suitable for V2 and Trident printer designs. The entire toolhead moves to trigger the optical switch, providing better precision than conventional limit switches and can be used with almost all print platforms.

    :::warning

    Voron Tap is not recommended to connect **24V**, some versions using **24V** have a certain probability of damaging the Tap sensor, this is not a problem with the Fly product, but a design flaw of Voron Tap, please be aware!!!

    :::

    :::danger

    Note: 5V and GND cannot be reversed, otherwise it will damage the Tap sensor and even the motherboard!!!

## FLY-Mini12864 LCD Wiring

* The diagram below shows the wiring method for the FLY mini12864. Please consult the respective manufacturer for screens from other manufacturers. If the Mini12864 screen is wired incorrectly, it may cause the host computer to fail to connect to the MCU. If you can normally connect the motherboard's MCU with the mini12864 screen before using it, and after using the mini12864 screen, you can no longer connect to the MCU, try unplugging the mini12864 wiring!!!

## Connecting to Host

* The motherboard connects to the host's USB port via a Type-C interface, or it can connect to the host through a serial port. Only the former is described here.
