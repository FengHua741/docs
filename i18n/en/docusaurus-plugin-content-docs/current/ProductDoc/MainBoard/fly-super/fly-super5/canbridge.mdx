# CAN Bridge

CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus designed for real-time applications, which can transmit signals using twisted-pair wiring and is one of the most widely used field buses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various different components in a car, thereby replacing expensive and cumbersome wiring harnesses. The robustness of this protocol has extended its use to other automation and industrial applications. Features of the CAN protocol include complete serial data communication, real-time support, transmission rates up to 1Mb/s, and addressing with 11-bit identifiers as well as error detection capabilities.
On 3D printers, CAN bus is used to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the motherboard. Originally, it required dozens of wires, but with CAN, only four wires are needed, significantly reducing the number of wires and simplifying cabling.
This chapter provides a brief overview of using the CAN bridge.

## Tool Board Connecting to Motherboard via CAN

    * Note that the power line of the tool board is not connected to the CAN port but to the 12V-24V power supply line.

## Flashing Motherboard Firmware

* Ensure that the firmware burned onto the SUPER5 PRO motherboard is `USB bridge CAN firmware configuration`.
