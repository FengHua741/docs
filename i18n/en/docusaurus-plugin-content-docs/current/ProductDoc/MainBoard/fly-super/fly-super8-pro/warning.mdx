# Main Board Precautions

## Power Indicator

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8-pro/img/power.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />
    * When powered only through TYPE-C without connecting other motherboard power, at least two lights `3.3V` and `5V` should be on.
    * After connecting to the motherboard power, the motherboard power light should illuminate `3.3V`, `5V`, and `12V`.
    * The power indicator on the bottom left of the motherboard will only light up normally after the driver power 0-2, driver power 3-7, and hotbed power are connected.

### Troubleshooting


    :::danger Notice

    * With no external devices connected (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
    * At least two LEDs, `3.3V` and `5V`, should remain constantly on when powered only through TYPE-C.

    :::

    * If `3.3V` and `5V` do not light up, please check the motherboard's 5V jumper.
    * If the issue persists after changing the jumper and confirming that the TYPE-C is supplying power correctly, contact customer service.
    * If one of the lights `3.3V`, `5V`, or `12V` is blinking, it indicates a chip short circuit, and you need to contact customer service.

## Drivers

    * Pay attention to the driver power, which is divided into two routes: the first route powers drivers 3-7, and the second route powers 0-2.
    * The motherboard supports external drivers     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Guide</Button>

## Limit Switches

    * Except for the last driver port (Drive7), which has an infinite limit switch, all other driver ports have infinite limits directly connected to the limit switch.
    * If the limit switch does not work, you can replace the limit switch or cut off the infinite limit pin of the driver.

## Firmware Burning

    * The motherboard uses an SD card for burning.
    * Due to tutorial issues, DFU was previously used for burning. If you need to update the firmware, you need to <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8-pro/flash/bl">re-burn BL</Button>.
