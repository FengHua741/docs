# CAN Bridge

CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus used for real-time applications, which can transmit signals using twisted-pair wires and is one of the most widely used field buses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various different components in a car, thereby replacing expensive and bulky wiring harnesses. The robustness of this protocol extends its use to other automation and industrial applications. Features of the CAN protocol include complete serial data communication, real-time support, transmission rates up to 1Mb/s, 11-bit addressing, and error detection capabilities.
On 3D printers, CAN bus is used to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the motherboard. Originally, it required dozens of wires, but with CAN, only four wires are needed, significantly reducing the number of wires and simplifying cabling.
This chapter briefly outlines the use of CAN bridging.

## Using CAN to Connect Tools Board to Mainboard

* Note that the power line of the tools board is not connected to the CAN port but to the 12V-24V power supply line.

## Flashing the Mainboard Firmware

* Ensure that the firmware burned onto the SUPER8 motherboard is `USB bridge CAN firmware configuration`.
