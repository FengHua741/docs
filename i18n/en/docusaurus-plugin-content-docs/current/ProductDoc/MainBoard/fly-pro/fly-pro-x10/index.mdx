## Product Features

    * Uses a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M7 series STM32H723ZGT6 main control chip with a frequency of 550 MHz
    * The motherboard and core board use the BTB connection method, allowing the use of Orange Pi CM4 and Raspberry Pi CM4 core boards
    * The motherboard has a BOOT button reserved for users to update the motherboard boot program via DFU
    * Ten plug-and-play TP drivers that can be used without any jumpers for switching driver modes
    * Onboard DIAG function pins that can be used by simply plugging or unplugging a jumper cap for infinite position reset
    * Drive power supports HVIN and VIN power selection
    * Firmware upgrades for the MCU can be done through a MicroSD card or updated via DFU using Klipperâ€™s make flash command
    * Six two-wire controllable fans, and support for removable MOS, two four-wire fans, one VCC fan
    * Adjustable fan voltage options: 24V, 12V, 5V, eliminating the need for customers to use external voltage regulation modules, thus reducing the likelihood of motherboard damage
    * Replacesable fuses for easy replacement;
