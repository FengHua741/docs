# Mainboard Precautions

## Power Indicator
    * When using Type-C for power supply without connecting other mainboard power, it should light up `SYS_5V` and SYS_3.3V.
    * After connecting the mainboard power `HVIN`, `VIN`, `BOARO`, `POWER`, the mainboard power indicator should remain on.

## Driver

    * TP5160 and TP2209 are just different names, and there is no need to switch jumpers to select the drive mode.
    * The drive port can only be installed with TP drivers and cannot install other devices.

## Limit Port
    * ProX10 supports 5V and 12V power selection. Please note that if using proximity switches, a diode needs to be installed for voltage reduction.

## Host Computer
    * ProX10 supports using an external host computer. By setting the DIP switch to connect Type-C, it can be used.

## Firmware Burning

    * The mainboard supports burning using an SD card, but the factory default is `Katapult`.
    * If you need to burn using an SD card, you need to re-burn BL first.
