Use the Katapult firmware to conveniently update the firmware via SSH in the future, without needing to enter DFU mode for firmware burning.

## Installation of Flashing Plugin

:::tip
Please note that installing the flashing plugin requires an internet-connected host machine.
If it has already been installed, there is no need to install it again.
:::

    * Install `pip install pyserial`

        ```bash
        pip install pyserial
        ```

    * If prompted with `-bash: pip: command not found`, execute the following:

        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install pip
        ```

    * If you encounter the error shown below, execute the following:

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/pyserial.png').default} size="100%" align="left" />

        ```bash
        pip install pyserial --break-system-packages
        ```

## Start Flashing Firmware

    * Use the following command to search for your device's serial port address:

        ```bash
        ls /dev/serial/by-id/*
        ```

    * Below is a reference:
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/katapult1.png').default} size="100%" align="left" />


    * To flash the firmware, use the following command. Ensure that the firmware has been compiled and note that there should be no space after `=`.
    * Please ensure you are in the klipper directory to flash the firmware.

        ```bash
        make flash FLASH_DEVICE=
        ```

    * Below is a reference:
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/katapult2.png').default} size="100%" align="left" />

    * After flashing, refer to the following:
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/katapult3.png').default} size="100%" align="left" />

## Method to Update Firmware

    * To update the USB firmware, input the following command after compiling the latest firmware. Note that there should be no space after `=`.
    
        ```bash
        make flash FLASH_DEVICE=
        ```
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/katapult4.png').default} size="100%" align="left" />

    * To update the USB bridge CAN firmware, input the following command after compiling the latest firmware to reset into Katapult.
    * Please note that this command can only be executed on the klipper firmware for the USB bridge CAN; executing it on other firmwares will result in errors.

        ```bash
        ~/klippy-env/bin/python3 ~/katapult/scripts/flashtool.py -i can0 -r -u <MCU ID>
        ```

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/katapult5.png').default} size="100%" align="left" />
    * After resetting into Katapult, execute the following command to update the firmware:

        ```bash
        make flash FLASH_DEVICE=<your device serial port address>
        ```

## Solution for Incorrect Firmware Flashing

    * Power off the motherboard, then power it back on and quickly click the reset button twice.
    * Alternatively, use WINDOWS to clean the firmware and then reflash BL
