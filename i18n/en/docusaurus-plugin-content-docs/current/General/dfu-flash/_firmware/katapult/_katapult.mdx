    * Katapult firmware is a type of bootloader that can be used in conjunction with Klipper. After being flashed using methods like DFU, you can use commands to update the firmware in one click.
    * Advantages: Double resetting or quickly cutting power twice will enter the Katapult firmware, and the pre-configured LED will flash; if not configured, it won't flash.
