    1. Install the flashing tool

    * No need to install the flashing tool for the FLY GUI.
    * If you need to install it, please note: The GUI needs to be connected to the internet to install properly.
    * If you have already installed it, no need to install again.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install dfu-util -y
    ```

    2. Execute the following command to check if the connection is successful.

    ```bash
    lsusb
    ```

    * If there is no DFU device, please try to re-enter **flashing mode**.
    * Due to system version issues, other names may be displayed. If `0483:df11` is shown, it indicates that the flashing mode has been entered.


        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/lsusb.png').default} size="80%" align="left" />    


    3. Flash the firmware

    * Execute the code below to start flashing.

    ```bash
    sudo dfu-util -a 0 -d 0483:df11 --dfuse-address 0x08000000 -D ~/klipper/out/klipper.bin
    ```

    4. If the following content is shown at the arrow as ``File downloaded successfully``, the flashing is successful.

    After flashing is complete, you need to power off the motherboard completely.
