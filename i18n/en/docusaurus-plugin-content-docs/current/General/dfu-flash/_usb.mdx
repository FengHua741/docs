    * Please ensure that the host machine can connect to the internet normally.
    * Please ensure that the data cable connecting the host and the device has data transmission capabilities.
    * After SSH connecting to the host machine, input `lsusb` and press enter. You may encounter one of the following three scenarios:
        * It shows that USB devices have been recognized.
        * It prompts that there is no `ls` command, which can be resolved by executing this command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
        * No error message, but also no other information (this indicates a system problem and requires replacing the system).
    * If there is no reaction after inputting `lsusb`, this indicates a system problem beyond our control. You need to replace the system with a confirmed working one.
    * If the information circled in the image below appears, you can proceed to the next step.

    * `1d50:6177` belongs to the device you will be using. Ignore the subsequent prompts as system issues might cause them to display incompletely or not at all.
    * If not, check if the data cable is properly connected or if the motherboard is in Katapult mode (formerly known as CANBOOT).
    * If you have already used Katapult to burn the klipper firmware, refer to the method for updating the firmware below.

    :::warning Note

    Proceed to the next step only if `1d50:6177` is present.
