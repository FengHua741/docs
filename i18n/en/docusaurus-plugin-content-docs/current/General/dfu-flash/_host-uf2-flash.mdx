    ```bash
    cd ~/klipper/lib/rp2040_flash/ && make
    ```
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/2040.png').default} size="100%" align="left" />

2. Execute the following command to check if the connection is successful.


    * Enter `lsusb`
    * If there is no `2e8a:0003` device, please try to re-enter **flashing mode**
    * Due to system version issues, it may display other names. If there is a `2e8a:0003`, it indicates that the flashing mode has been entered.

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/2e8a.png').default} size="80%" align="left" />
