    * Please ensure the host machine can connect to the network normally.
    * Please ensure the data cable connecting the lower-level machine to the host machine has data transfer capabilities.
    * After SSH connecting to the host machine, input `lsusb` and press enter. One of the following three situations may occur:
        * Displays recognized USB devices.
        * Prompts that there is no `ls` command; you can execute this command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
        * No error message, no other information (system issues need to be replaced with a normal system).
    * If there is no reaction after entering `lsusb`, this indicates a system issue beyond our control, and you need to replace it with a confirmed normal system.
    * If the information circled in the image below appears, you can proceed to the next step.

    * `1d50:606f` belongs to the device you will use this time. Ignore the subsequent prompts as system issues may cause them to display incompletely or not at all.
    * If there are two `1d50:606f`, you need to determine why there are two and exclude one before restarting the system.
    * Two `1d50:606f` will affect subsequent burning and firmware connections, such as for `FLY MINI PAD`, it is recommended to use only the on-board UTOC and not other CAN bridge devices.
    * If there is no `1d50:606f`, please check if the data cable is properly connected and if the firmware has been correctly flashed.

    :::warning Note

    You can proceed to the next step only if there is a `1d50:606f`.
