    * Ensure the data cable connecting the lower-level machine to the host machine has data transmission capabilities.

            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
        * No error message, no other information (a system issue requires replacing the system).

    * If the information circled in the image below appears, you can proceed to the next step.

    * If not, check whether the data cable is properly connected or if the motherboard has entered DFU.

    :::warning Note

    Proceed to the next step only if you have `0843:df11`.
