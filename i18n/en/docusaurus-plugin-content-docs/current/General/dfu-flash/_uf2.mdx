    * Please ensure the host machine can connect to the internet normally.
    * Please ensure the data cable connecting the lower-level machine to the host machine has data transfer capabilities.
    * After SSH connecting to the host machine, input `lsusb` and press enter. One of the following three situations may occur:
        * It displays USB devices that have been recognized.
        * It prompts that there is no `ls` command, you can execute this command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
        * There are no errors, but no other information (this indicates a system problem and needs a system replacement).
    * If there is no reaction after entering `lsusb`, this indicates a system problem and we cannot help here; you need to replace with a confirmed normal system.
    * If the information circled in the following image appears, you can proceed to the next step.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/2e8a.png').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 
    * `2e8a:0003` belongs to the device you will use this time. Ignore the subsequent prompts as system issues might cause them to display incompletely or not at all.
    * If not, please check if the data cable is properly connected or if the motherboard is in Katapult mode (formerly CANBOOT).

    :::warning Note

    Proceed to the next step only when you have `2e8a:0003`.
