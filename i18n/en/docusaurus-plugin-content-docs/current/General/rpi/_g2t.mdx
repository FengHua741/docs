## Precautions:

    * Ensure the main unit is powered off before installing the expansion board.
    * Avoid using the expansion board in damp or dusty environments.
    * When installing the screen, please note not to plug and unplug it while powered on. Pay attention to the direction of the screen cable to avoid damage.
    * When installing the fan, pay attention to the current and voltage specifications of the fan to avoid damage.
    * Note that UART1 is already enabled by default and does not need to be configured.
    * Please flash the latest image, such as `mainsailos`, instead of upgrading the kernel.
    * **The Raspberry Pi can use all interfaces!!!**
    * **Note:** The system kernel version used by the Raspberry Pi must be greater than `5.17.x`. Run the command `uname -r` to check the kernel version.

## Installation of Screen Driver

    * Note that you can directly use the pre-installed system.
    * Project address: [FLY-TFT](https://github.com/kluoyun/FLY-TFT)

### Introduction

    FLY-TFT-V2 is a TFT LCD screen based on st7796, supporting both capacitive touch and resistive touch, with a resolution of 320x480, using SPI interface.

    * You need to install [KlipperScreen](https://klipperscreen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation/) yourself.

### System Installation

:::warning Precautions
Note: The system kernel version used by the Raspberry Pi must be greater than `5.17.x`. Run the command `uname -r` to check the kernel version.
Please flash the latest image, such as `mainsailos`, instead of upgrading the kernel.
:::

* Use [Raspberry Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to install the latest **MainsailOS**
    1. Download and install [Raspberry Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
    2. Open **Raspberry Imager**
    3. Click **CHOOSE DEVICE**
    4. Select the corresponding model according to your device
    5. Click **CHOOSE OS**
    6. Select **Other specific-purpose OS**
    7. Select **3D printing**
    8. Select **Mainsail OS**
    9. Select the latest version. If your settings support 64-bit systems, choose **rpi64**
    10. Click **CHOOSE STORAGE**
    11. Select your storage device, such as an SD card
    12. Click **NEXT**, wait for installation to complete

### Driver Installation

    * Install FLY-TFT-V2 driver
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kluoyun/FLY-TFT.git
    cd FLY-TFT
    sudo chmod +x ./scripts/install.sh
    ./scripts/install.sh
    ```

### Enabling TFT Display

    * Touch requires enabling I2C support, the corresponding configuration is `dtparam=i2c_arm=on`

    1. After installing the driver, add the overlay support `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2` to the config.txt file
    2. Open `/boot/config.txt` (for bookworm system, it's `/boot/firmware/config.txt`)
        ```bash
        sudo nano /boot/config.txt
        ```
    3. Add the following configuration at the end of the file
    ```bash
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2
    ```
    * By default, the screen displays horizontally at 90 degrees. If you need to rotate the screen, use the following configuration
    ```bash
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r90  # 90 degrees horizontal, same as default orientation
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r270 # 270 degrees horizontal, flipped
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r0   # 0 degrees vertical, portrait
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r180 # 180 degrees vertical, flipped
    ```
        * Only one configuration can be added, multiple configurations cannot be added
        * Normally, the touch direction of the TFT will automatically follow the display direction without modifying the touch configuration in the system
    4. After adding to the end of the file, run the command `sudo reboot` to restart the system

### Using TFT

    * Ensure the hardware connection is correct
    * The driver has been installed
    * Added `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2` overlay support to the `/boot/config.txt` (for bookworm system, it's `/boot/firmware/config.txt`) file
    * Some systems may have a default fb0 device, FLY-TFT will be assigned to the fb1 device. You need to modify the configuration file to enable the fb1 device
    * Run the command `ls /dev/fb*` to view the device. If two devices, fb0 and fb1, appear, run the following command to enable the fb1 device (by default it is fb0)
    * Run the following command to modify the default configuration to the fb1 device
        ```bash
        sudo sed -i 's/\/dev\/fb0/\/dev\/fb1/g' /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.conf
        ```

### Using KlipperScreen

    * KlipperScreen is not installed by default in MainsailOS and needs to be installed manually
    * Refer to [KlipperScreen](https://github.com/KlipperScreen/KlipperScreen) or use [kiauh](https://github.com/dw-0/kiauh) to install
    * If KlipperScreen is successfully installed and step 5 is correctly completed, the KlipperScreen interface should now be displayed

### All Available Configurations

    * `speed` [**requires parameter**]: Set the maximum SPI clock frequency for the TFT, in Hz. Default is 96000000. If severe screen artifacts occur, reduce this value appropriately.
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,speed=80000000` 

    * `r0/r90/r180/r270` [**optional**][**no parameter required**]: Set the display and touch direction of the TFT. Default is 90 degrees. Possible values are 0, 90, 180, 270 (only one configuration can be added).
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r90` or `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r180`

    * `disable_touch` [**no parameter required**]: Disable the touch function of the TFT. Default is enabled.
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,disable_touch`

    * `invx`,`invy` [**no parameter required**]: Set the touch direction of the TFT. `invx` flips the X direction, `invy` flips the Y direction.
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,invx` or `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,invy` or `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,invx,invy`

    * `swapxy` [**no parameter required**]: Set the touch direction of the TFT. Swap the X and Y axes, i.e., rotate the screen horizontally.
        * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,swapxy`

    > **Note:** Multiple parameters can be set simultaneously (optional parameters can only select one). Multiple parameters should be separated by commas and can only be set on one line.

    > **Warning:** Normally, only `r0`, `r90`, `r180`, `r270` parameters are used. Other parameters are only used in special cases, especially `invx`, `invy`, `swapxy`.
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,speed=80000000,r270`
