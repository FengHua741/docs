## Search USB Tutorial

## Precautions Before Searching for Devices

    * Before searching for the USB ID, please first [connect to SSH](/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/index.mdx "click to jump")
    * Please make sure you are logging in via network SSH rather than serial port SSH
    * Please ensure that the motherboard with the USB firmware installed is properly connected, and the data cable connecting it to the host computer has data transfer capability

## Search for Devices

    * Now that you have successfully logged into the host machine, you can enter `lsusb` to search for devices. You will encounter one of the following scenarios:
        * If entering `lsusb` prompts that the `ls` command is not found, you can enter the following command to install the command:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
        * If entering `lsusb` produces no response, this indicates a system issue beyond our control. You need to change the system or use a confirmed working system.
        * If you see the information shown in the image below, note that this is just a reference. You only need to confirm the characters after the ID.

    * `1d50:614e` belongs to the device you will be using. Ignore the rest of the prompt as the system issue may cause it to display incompletely or not at all.
    * If none of the above occur, please check if the data cable is properly connected and if the firmware is correctly installed.

:::warning Note
You can only search for the USB ID when you have `1d50:614e`.

## Search for USB ID

    ```bash
    ls /dev/serial/by-id/*
    ```

    * Enter the command below and press Enter. If everything is normal, a blue ID will appear (the one below is just an example).
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/usb-id.png').default} size="80%" align="left" />
    * If no ID appears after entering the command below, but `lsusb` shows devices, try changing the host machine or the host machine's system.

:::warning Note
If multiple IDs appear, select the appropriate one based on your motherboard's **MCU** model.

### Fill in the USB ID in the Configuration

    * Open the printer web interface, find the configuration option in the left sidebar: for fluidd, it is `{...}`; for mainsail, it is `machine`, and click to access `printer.cfg`.

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/fluidd-cfg.png').default} size="50%" align="left" />

    * Copy the blue ID and fill it into the `[mcu]` section of the `serial:` parameter in the `printer.cfg` configuration file. Save and restart to connect to the motherboard. If Klipper displays ``ADC out of range``, it is normal. Connect the bed and thermistor properly, configure the hotend and bed thermistor and output pins, then save and restart.

Note: All IDs mentioned in the document are examples. The actual ID for each motherboard is unique. Please modify according to the actual ID obtained.
