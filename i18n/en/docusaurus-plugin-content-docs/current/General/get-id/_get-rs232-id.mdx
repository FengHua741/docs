## Search for RS232 ID

### Precautions Before Searching for Devices

    * Before searching for the RS232 ID, please first [connect to SSH](/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/index.mdx "click to jump")
    * Please note that you need to ensure that you are logging in via SSH using the network, not via a serial port
    * Please ensure that UTOR is properly connected and that the data cable connecting to the host computer has data transfer capabilities
    * If using G2T, confirm whether the system supports UART connection

### Searching for Devices

    * Now that you have successfully logged into the host machine, you can enter `lsusb` to search for devices. This will result in one of the following scenarios:
        * If entering `lsusb` prompts that the `ls` command cannot be found, you can enter the following command to install the command:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
        * If entering `lsusb` results in no response, this indicates a system issue. You will need to change the system or use a confirmed working system.
        * If you see the information shown in the image below, please note that this is just a reference. You only need to determine the characters after the ID.

    * `1a86:7523` belongs to the device you need to use. The subsequent prompts do not need to be concerned with because system issues may cause it to display incompletely or not at all.
    * If none of these apply, please check if the data cable is properly connected and if the firmware has been correctly flashed.

    :::warning Note

    You can only use the commands below to search for the RS232 ID when you have `1a86:7523`.

### Searching for RS232 ID

    ```bash
    ls /dev/serial/by-path/*
    ```

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/rs232-id.png').default} size="100%" align="left" />
    * If entering `ls /dev/serial/by-path/*` does not produce any IDs, but `lsusb` shows devices, consider replacing the host machine or the host machine's system.
    * Please note that using UTOR will output three IDs, and if you have used another UTOR system before, it may record them, leading to multiple IDs appearing during the search.
    * Ensure that the ID ends with `-port0`, otherwise it cannot be used.

    :::warning Note

    Please make sure that the tool board and UTOR are grounded!!! Otherwise, you will not be able to connect to the tool board!!!

### Enter the RS232 ID into the Configuration

    * Open the printer web interface and find the `printer.cfg` configuration under the configuration option in the left sidebar. For fluidd, it is `{...}`; for mainsail, it is `machine`.

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/fluidd-cfg.png').default} size="50%" align="left" />

    * Copy the blue ID and paste it into the `[mcu]` section of the `printer.cfg` configuration file under `serial:`. After saving and restarting, you should be able to connect to the mainboard. If Klipper prompts ``ADC out of range``, this is normal. Connect the hotbed and thermistor properly, configure the thermistor pins and output pins for the nozzle and hotbed, then save and restart.

    :::warning Note

    * The RS232 ID needs to be configured with `baud:` and `restart_method:command`.
    * Below is a reference configuration:

    :::

        ```cfg
        [mcu SHT36]
        serial: /dev/serial/by-path/platform-1c1c000.usb-usb-0:1.2:1.0-port0
        baud: 250000
        restart_method:command
        ```

    :::danger

    Note: All IDs mentioned in the document are examples. Each motherboardâ€™s ID is unique, so please modify and fill in according to the actual ID obtained.

    :::

    :::danger

    Please note that the IDs below cannot be used!!!

    :::

        ```cfg
        serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB_Serial-if00-port0
        ```
