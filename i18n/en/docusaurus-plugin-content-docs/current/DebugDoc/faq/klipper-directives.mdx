# Common Debug Commands

    :::tip

    * This tutorial is based on the Fuiidd web page
    * This tutorial is for debugging purposes after the printer has been properly connected.
    * This tutorial provides commonly used commands, but due to various issues, it may not be completely comprehensive.

    :::

## Driver Related

    :::danger Notice

    * Please note that malfunctioning or improperly configured drivers cannot be checked.
    * Ensure all drivers, power supply, motherboard, and driver jumpers and configurations are correct!!

    :::


### Check Driver Status

    * This command verifies the status of TMC drivers in SPI/UART mode.
        ```bash
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_x
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_x1
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_y
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_y1
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_z
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_z1
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_z2
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_z3
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=extruder
        ```

### Force Move Drivers

    * Add the following command in `printer.cfg`.
        ```bash
        [force_move]
        enable_force_move: true
        ```

    * Force back-and-forth movement by 1mm.
        ```bash
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_x
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_x1
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_y
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_y1
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_z
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_z1
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_z2
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_z3
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=extruder
        ```

    * Enable this option to force move through movement control.
    * Please note that only one motor can be moved at a time.
    * If multiple axes are involved, such as two Z axes, they need to be homed before controlling.

### Force Set Print Head Distance

    * Enter the following command in the console to force set the print head position and directly control the movement.
        ```bash
        SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION x=100 y=100 z=100
        ```

### Step Motor Step Value Calibration
    * First ensure the extruder driver is functioning correctly, then confirm that `full_steps_per_rotation` and `gear_ratio` are correct; otherwise, extruder step value calibration will fail.
    * Obtain the new `rotation_distance`, rounding it to three decimal places.
    * Calibrate the step value: `rotation_distance = old_rotation_distance * actual_extrusion_length / requested_extrusion_length`
    
        ```bash
        full_steps_per_rotation: 200        # Number of pulses per rotation (200 for 1.8째, 400 for 0.9째)
        gear_ratio: 50:10                   # Gear ratio (Galileo gear ratio 7.5:1, comment out this line; BMG 50:17, output shaft first, input shaft second)
        rotation_distance: 22.522           # Pulley circumference mm
        ```

## Heating Related

### PID
    :::tip
    * The `TARGET=` in the command sets the temperature, please set it according to your usual printing temperature.
    * If you have multiple heating devices, you can use these commands for PID tuning.
    :::

    * Extruder
        ```bash
        PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=245
        ```

    * Bed
        ```bash
        PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=100
        ```

    * PTC
        ```bash
        PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=PTC TARGET=70
        ```

### Temperature Error Related

    :::tip
    * If heating takes too long, refer to this method <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/DebugDoc/ref-config/m109">Click to Jump</Button>
    * Please note that if the temperature is unstable, use this method to resolve errors caused by unstable temperatures <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/DebugDoc/ref-config/verify_heater">Click to Jump</Button>

## Limit Switch Related

    :::tip
    * Currently being updated.
    :::

### Normal Limit Switch
    * Limit switch check command.
    * Ensure the limit switch is a two-wire type. If it is a three-wire type, verify that the wiring sequence is correct; otherwise, it could damage the motherboard!!!
    * Ensure the limit switch is normally open and not triggered by any object.
    * Enter the following command in the console. If it works correctly, it will return the following information:
        ```bash
        QUERY_ENDSTOPS
        ```
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/query.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />
    * Ensure the limit switch is in the open state, then manually press the limit switch and enter `QUERY_ENDSTOPS`.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/query1.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />
    * A change in the limit switch status indicates correct wiring.

### No Limit Switch
    * Note that the no-limit switch state should always be open; otherwise, there might be an issue with the configuration or wiring.
    * Enter the following command in the console. If it works correctly, it will return the following information:
        ```bash
        QUERY_ENDSTOPS
        ```
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/query.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />

## Probe Related

### BL-TOUCH

    * pin_down: Probe extends.
    * pin_up: Probe retracts.
    * touch_mode: Verify sensor.
    ```bash
    BLTOUCH_DEBUG COMMAND=pin_down
    BLTOUCH_DEBUG COMMAND=pin_up
    BLTOUCH_DEBUG COMMAND=touch_mode
    touch_mode
    ```

### Probe & TAP

    * Normally untriggered.
    * It is recommended to add `^` when configuring the pin.
    ```bash
    QUERY_PROBE
    ```
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/probe.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />

### Repeatability Accuracy
    * Ten times.
        ```bash
        probe_accuracy
        ```
    * One hundred times.
        ```bash
        probe_accuracy samples=100
        ```

### Servo

    :::tip
    * Servos are available in 180째 and 360째 versions. Please distinguish between them.
    :::

    * Reference configuration.
        ```cfg
        [servo my_servo]
        pin:PE6
        ```

    * Reference command.
        ```bash
        SET_SERVO SERVO=my_servo ANGLE=360
        SET_SERVO SERVO=my_servo ANGLE=180
        SET_SERVO SERVO=my_servo ANGLE=0
        ```
