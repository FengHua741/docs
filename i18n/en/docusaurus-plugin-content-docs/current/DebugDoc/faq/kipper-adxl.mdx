## Install Dependencies

:::tip
It is recommended to use SSH tools such as `MobaXterm_Personal` for operation.
:::

:::tip
The FLY host machine does not need to execute, as it already comes with the accelerometer dependency package.
:::

    * Please execute the following commands in sequence to install the dependencies.
    * Note that depending on the performance of your CPU, it may take a lot of time, up to 10-20 minutes. Please be patient and wait for the installation to complete. In some cases, if the motherboard's RAM is too low, the installation may fail.

        ```bash
        sudo apt install python3-numpy python3-matplotlib libatlas-base-dev
        ```

        ```bash
        ~/klippy-env/bin/pip install matplotlib numpy
        ```

## Test Accelerometer

    * You need to reset before executing.
    * Execute `ACCELEROMETER_QUERY` in the console.
    * For multiple accelerometers, you can specify testing one by using `ACCELEROMETER_QUERY CHIP=<ADXL>`, where `<ADXL>` needs to be replaced with the corresponding accelerometer name.
    * If there is an error, please check the wiring and configuration.
    * The normal output is shown below:
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/adxl_1.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />
    * This allows you to perform resonance compensation measurement.


## Calibrate Accelerometer

    * Reset.
    * Enter `SHAPER_CALIBRATE` in the console to start automatic calibration for X and Y.
    * After calibration is completed, execute `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the data.
    * You can also use `SHAPER_CALIBRATE AXIS=X` to automatically calibrate one axis.
    * The calibration process may take a long time, so please be patient.

:::tip
Attention! If the printer vibrates too violently during the test, please press the emergency stop immediately or send `M112` to stop it.
:::

    * An excessively high `accel_per_hz` can make vibrations more intense; you can reduce it appropriately.

        ```cfg
        [resonance_tester]
        accel_chip: adxl345
        accel_per_hz: 50  # Default value is 75
        probe_points: ...
        ```
