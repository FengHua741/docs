# USB Drive Printing

This tutorial is only applicable to the FLY host machine.

    :::danger Notice

    * You need to install it yourself.
    * This tutorial will replace the `klipper/klippy/extras/virtual_sdcard.py` file in Klipper.
    * It allows automatic copying of files selected from a USB drive to the system’s `/tmp` directory.
    * After the copy is completed, it will prompt `File selected` in the web command line.
    * This file will detect the `sdaX` folder; if not found, it will not execute (where X in sda represents A-Z and 0-9).
    * Currently, only the FLY host machine has been tested; other host machines have not been tested.

    :::

## Usage Instructions



* Use an SSH software to connect to the host machine and execute the following command.
* Please note that this command will restart the host machine!
* This step is to enable USB drive printing functionality.
    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf /etc/udev/rules.d/fly_devices.rules && sudo wget https://upyun.pan.zxkxz.cn/Utils/fly_devices.rules -O /etc/udev/rules.d/fly_devices.rules > /dev/null 2>&1 && sudo chmod +x /etc/udev/rules.d/fly_devices.rules && sudo service udev restart && sudo reboot
    ```
