# Host Machine Guide

## How to get my newly purchased host machine running

  1. First, determine the model of your host machine, such as Lite 2 or PI V2, etc.
  2. Have you prepared the following items?
        * Burning software
        * Corresponding system image
        * Reader, TF card, and a TYPE-C with data transfer capability

  Precautions before system burning:
        * Please ensure that the memory card capacity must be no less than `16GB` or no more than `128GB`, and the transfer speed must be at least `class10`. It is recommended to use brands like SanDisk for the TF card.
        * Do not update the system arbitrarily! Updates can easily cause problems when servers are located abroad.
        * Try to use the recommended software for operations.
        * It is highly recommended to learn some LINUX knowledge. Personally, I recommend <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="https://item.jd.com/12443890.html">"The Bird's Private Recipe of Linux Basic Learning Edition"</Button>, etc.

## After downloading all the necessary tools and corresponding system images

  * Extract the system. The file extension after extraction should be `.img`.
  * Use SDFormatter to reformat the memory card.
  * Use `win32DiskImager` to burn the image into the system.
  * If it is a FLY host machine, open `FlyOS-Env.txt` for configuration.
  * Do not format the system after it has been burned!!

## Starting the System

  * After the system has been burned, install the system card in the host machine and power it on.
  * At this point, the system has been burned and configured. Connect to the computer using a TYPE-C cable with data transfer capabilities via a serial port.
  * Please note that other host machines will normally display log loading. If logs are not shown, press the enter key twice or reflash the system.
  * Once started, connect to Wi-Fi.

## About M2WE and Memory Card Usage Instructions

  * If the device is equipped with M2WE and a memory card, the system will boot from the memory card by default.
  * It is recommended to use an SD card for burning the system on M2WE. Using USB to burn the system to M2WE may fail due to driver compatibility issues. It is recommended to directly use the memory card for burning.
  * Please ensure that the downloaded system image is correct; otherwise, it will not boot.
  * Please note that Lite2 and MINI PAD can only use memory cards.
