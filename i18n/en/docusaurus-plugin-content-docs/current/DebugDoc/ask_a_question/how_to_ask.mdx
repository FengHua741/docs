# Read Before Asking Questions

  * QQ/WeChat and other communication tools provide quick and convenient ways to communicate, but if you encounter a problem, it is recommended to follow these steps.
  * Whether you can get a useful answer often depends on how you ask and follow up.

## Problem Solving Steps:

  1. Try to solve it yourself: Use your knowledge to try to solve the problem yourself. Don't be intimidated by English output messages; try to understand them. Most information outputs are directional, and you just need to find them and attempt to solve the problem yourself.
  2. Search online: Look online to see if anyone else has encountered a similar problem. If so, refer to their solutions first. If not, then ask in the group.
  3. Ask in the group: When asking in the group, describe the problem clearly and attach screenshots to help others quickly identify the issue. The more information you prepare, the higher the efficiency of others solving your problem will be.

## To Increase the Chances of Your Question Being Quickly Resolved, Try to Do the Following:

### Always Think from the Perspective of the Answerer

  Each time you ask a question, think from the perspective of the answerer:
  * Assume that the answerers are all experts who value their time.
  * How can I make my question easily understandable at a glance? Ideally, don't let the answerer have to chase me for basic questions about what I did and why.
  * What can make answerers willing to answer my question? Is it because of technical discussion depth, or does it make the answerer feel revered, or because I can pay them?
  * Don't make the answerer think I am lazy, haven't read the documentation, haven't looked at the code, haven't checked the logs, haven't searched, haven't thought, haven't tried, haven't made any effort, and directly came to ask a question.

### Clarify the Problem and Understand What Happened and What You Did:

  * What effect or function do I want to achieve?
  * How did I go about achieving this effect? What was the detailed process?
  * What errors occurred during implementation? What were the symptoms (e.g., error messages, **complete** error content)? Avoid looking only at the last few lines; try to look further into the logs.
  * Did I carefully read the error message? Was there any hint about the cause and solution in the error message?
  * Based on these error messages, did I think carefully enough to solve the problem?
  * Searched the documentation, FAQs, issues, and used search engines to find solutions to the problem.
  * `If you feel that the documentation is incomplete, point it out directly!! Don't worry about anything else, I'm not an expert and there may be places I haven't considered!!`

## Inefficient or Unproductive Questions

  <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/ask_a_question/img/uuid.png').default} size="100%" align="left" />
  * Ask: "Please, can someone help me with this problem?"

### Issues with These Questions

  * *Snapshots Instead of Screenshots* Take a screenshot instead of a photo unless there is a special situation where a clearer photo is needed. Learn to use the screenshot features of various tools.
  * *Incomplete Information* There are many reasons CAN can't find an ID, such as wrong wiring, mismatched baud rates between the host and slave. Limit your problem to a specific scenario and provide concrete conditions to help focus on the issue.
  * For those who don't know how to take screenshots, here is a [screenshot tutorial](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1LB4y1t7jy/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=36affb37d7228751cd1fcbbda487dfdf).

## Question Template

Try to make your question elegant, without adding unnecessary words, complaints, and ponder each word and punctuation mark, thinking from the perspective of the answerer, how to make the answerer quickly help you solve the problem. Too few words may not describe the problem clearly, while too many words may make people lose patience.

### If You Really Can't Solve the Problem Yourself and Need to Ask Others, Consider:

  * Who to ask, where to ask, and who is more likely to answer your question and how quickly?
    * Provide what information and phenomena can make them willing to help solve the problem quickly?
      * Provide my purpose (to help the answerer understand what you are doing).
      * Provide the complete implementation process and any phenomena (to help the answerer follow your steps to reproduce the problem).
      * Point out where the error occurred, where the phenomenon or result differs from expectations! (To help the answerer understand where it didn't meet expectations).
      * Provide the error information, including complete logs, screenshots, etc. Don't be stingy with small images or parts of logs (because the answerer might have forgotten some details and needs screenshots and complete logs to quickly recall them; detailed logs can also help pinpoint the issue quickly).

  * How to ask questions in a way that seems sincere. Even if I am a beginner, everyone is willing to answer.

### Title

  When asking a question, draft a title of around **30** characters that summarizes the core idea of the problem, including:
  * Problem category, whether it's a question, bug report, experience sharing, etc. This helps others quickly locate what you want to do on a screen full of text.
  * Summarize the central idea of the problem in one sentence, such as encountering "CAN can't find ID, motherboard connection failure," etc.

  So a combined title could be like this:
  * `【Question】SHT36V3 can't find CANID after confirming what what`

  Such titles should **not** appear:
  * `Ah ah ah why can't my board find ID` (I don't know, I don't know how you wired and operated)
  * `Why doesn't my host machine start` (I don't know, I don't know which host machine)
  * `Why don't I have a device` (I don't know, I don't know which product)
  * `What's this error message` (Didn't read the documentation, straight to asking)
  * `Received motherboard, how to connect drivers` (Didn't read the documentation, straight to asking)
  * `How to connect this cable` (What's the problem?)
  * `Why can't I flash after entering DFU, why can't I enter DFU` (You need to tell us how you operated and how you connected, otherwise others might think you're just guessing and won't bother answering)

  You could ask like this:
  * `【Question】After reversing the power on my board, the board can't start now. How can I determine where it's burned, and if possible, how can I revive it?`
  * `【Bug】This part of the documentation is incomplete. I hope to add or modify similar content.`

### Reference Template

  * Take a moment to organize the problem and describe the following information clearly:
  * Whether you can get a useful answer often depends on how you ask and follow up.

  1. **What's the problem** Example: New motherboard and tool version can't find the device
  2. **What hardware equipment** Example: Set-top box + D5 motherboard + SHT36V3
  3. **How to connect** Example: Take a high-definition wiring diagram and send it to the expert
  4. **What problem phenomena** Example: Host machine inputs `lsusb` and no devices are found. Attach complete information screenshot.

  【Question】I bought a D5 motherboard and SHT36, when connecting to the set-top box host machine, `lsusb` cannot find any devices.
