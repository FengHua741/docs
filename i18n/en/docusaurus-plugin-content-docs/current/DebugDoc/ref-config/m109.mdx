# Print start temperature instability waiting time too long

    * This macro can be directly placed in the configuration.
    * The purpose of this macro is to normally wait for the temperature to rise, but once the temperature reaches the target, it proceeds to the next step immediately.
    ```cfg title="printer.cfg"
    [gcode_macro M109]
    rename_existing: M109.1
    gcode:
        {% set s = params.S|float %}
        M104 {% for p in params %}{'%s%s' % (p, params[p])}{% endfor %}  ; Set hotend temp
        {% if s != 0 %}
        TEMPERATURE_WAIT SENSOR=extruder MINIMUM={s} MAXIMUM={s+1}   ; Wait for hotend temp (within 1 degree)
        {% endif %}
